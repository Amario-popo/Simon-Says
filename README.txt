    Number generator will create a random number between 0 and 3 this will be saved in a variable array called (sequence_array)

    (sequence_array) will be used to store the required sequence to enter in order to gain a point

    Each time a point is gained the sequence will be increased by one

    The second array will be used to store the players input (player_array)

    The player will be able to enter a sequence of one of the four buttons corosponding to the four numbers

    After each button press the number will be added to the (player_array)

    if the (player array) is the same as the (sequence_array) the player will gain a point

    if the (player_array) is not the same as the (sequence_array) the game will end and the player will be asked to play again
